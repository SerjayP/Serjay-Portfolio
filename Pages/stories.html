        Former Water Use Inspector for the Department of Environmental Protection in NYC. I know a decent about NYC plumbing standards and the city water. It&apos;s also a great way to learn the city, being that every property has water and/or sewage. I went to high school in Hampton, Virginia. The only 3 years of my life living outside of New York. When I was growing up I wanted to be a police officer or full time gamer. I used to deliver food with Uber Eats and Caviar. Although I&apos;ve only jet skied once, I love it. ATVing is also very exhilarting!
